# Car Price Prediction - Streamlit App

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Car Price Prediction Streamlit App! This project aims to provide a user-friendly web application that predicts the price of a car based on various features. The app is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive web applications.

## Features

- Predict the price of a car based on its features.
- Explore the dataset and visualize the data.
- Input various car features, such as mileage, brand, year, and more, to get an estimated price.
- The app uses a trained machine learning model to make predictions.

## Installation

To run the Car Price Prediction Streamlit App on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction-streamlit.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd car-price-prediction-streamlit

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and activate it:
python -m venv venv
- For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
- For Unix or Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

4. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py

6. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the Car Price Prediction app.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is not included in this repository. However, you can find the dataset and additional information about it from the following source:

- [Car Dataset](https://www.example.com/car-dataset)

Please download the dataset and place it in the `data` directory of this repository before running the app.

## Project Structure

The repository has the following structure:

- `app.py`: The main Python script that contains the Streamlit app code.
- `data/`: Directory to store the dataset file (`car_dataset.csv`).
- `models/`: Directory to store the trained machine learning model file (`car_price_prediction_model.pkl`).
- `README.md`: This readme file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the app.

## Model Training

The machine learning model used in the app is trained separately and saved as a serialized file (`car_price_prediction_model.pkl`) in the `models` directory. If you wish to train your own model, you can refer to the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository.
